NAs in the loss function arise because of NAs in the input data set or because of low information predictors (genes).

If you are scaling the genes, then you will get NAs for genes with a standard deviation of 0 (and there are some).

Additionally, there are genes that do have a positive standard deviation but still have such a small amount of information that they also cause NAs in the loss function.

So I remove genes that are either 0  SD or have an average expression of < 1.

```{r}
novariation <- apply(pancandata, 2, sd)==0
pancandata <- pancandata[,!novariation]

lowexpression <- apply(pancandata, 2, mean) < 1
pancandata <- pancandata[, !lowexpression]
```

Other notes:

Remember to remove the sample ID column before running the above code

Remember that keras uses zero indexing, so your labels need to be integers from 0 to 4, rather than from 1 to 5.
